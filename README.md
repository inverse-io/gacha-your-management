# Gacha Your Management!
A time management system based on the style of a Gacha. 

## Structure and Organization
- `UserApp`: Represents the instance of the users application
- `GachaTimer`: Inherits from the TimerTask and creates the unique task of appending the user's number of 'pulls' or 'wishes'

**NOTE**: 
- `UserApp` may need to be renamed at a later date if a more appropriate title is found
- `GachaTimer` may be scrapped if it makes handling the users pulls easier

## Prerequisites
Java must be installed, and either an IDE or compiler capable of running or compiling the code.
